4: Loneliness
Molton was surprised, in the interview with Captain Wirwid, how little she actually knew about xeno-ethno-musicology, especially since the job description had specifically mentioned proficiency in human art forms.
Looking back, that should have been a clue not everything was on the up-and-up.
The first time he had met Wirwid, the Captain had been a she, and fully human, not just humanoid (mostly cyborg—that beard wasn't just for show, hosting a colony of microbacteria that enabled him to broadcast and receive low-level telepathic commands with the Remote, Multi-Hued Parabola), and she had definitely implied that, should he take the job, there would be sex involved. I’m sure we’ll find ways of keeping each other entertained, she had cooed.
Then, when they had met in the dry dock, Wirwid had been male. Not that sex necessarily needed to take place between reproductive gender pairings, but there was a kind of code of etiquette among metempsychotic organisms that when two sentients adopted the same bioform but with opposing genders, this was shorthand for erotic interest. Wirwid's sudden switch prior to departure—he claimed it was to grow the nanite-infested beard—struck Molton as a not-so-subtle rebuff, and a reneging on an implicit deal they had struck.
So, in all the time they had been in ship, nothing had happened between them. Well, it had, but only in the desultory way of mutually bored and slightly curious shipmates, but Wirwid was far more preoccupied and distant than the close spiritual bedfellow the anthro-bard had imagined when accepting the post.
In the extended dream-sessions, of course, they would fuck each other in all possible permutations at some point in the diffuse, epic scenarios the oneiric algorithms could devise, but that was just a necessary chore of psychic maintenance, needed for their health but not notably significant, rather like sharing meals.
It didn't take long, despite these entertainments, for the voyage to descend into the usual existential horrors of too much time in too little space. Dynamics soured, rhythms got thrown off by snored proximities and carelessly unfixed problems of passive aggression. Molton felt trapped, unable to follow his music out of his own habitual mind, the mundane strummings of uninspired and empty days. His soul was cramped.
They were on an inter-spacer without real cold sleep, just the hypnogogic tricks the bio-computer could plug them into. Things were bound to get weird, like when you said a word over and over until it became unrecognizably odd, the sound separated from meaning. All relationships, over a thousand years, took on cosmological import.
On a voyage that long, you became archetypes to each other.

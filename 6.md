# 6: Extinction

Mira watched Molton’s face. Her brain was roughly divided into eight sections, making her mildly schizophrenic by human standards. Animals on her home system had developed a cognitive/mnemonic strategy where they imagined eight different tasks, or concepts, or numbers, sounds, whatever, represented by the same number of objects, each held in a tentacle. Famously, Zenobians (as they were called) were absurdly good at literal and figurative juggling.

What she had given the bard was a cocktail that would allow him to read her facial expressions, and understand her language. The universal translators that Molton, like most sub-sentients, employed, conveyed rudimentary information from non-verbal and implicit sources, as much as needed to maintain a modicum of panversal etiquette, but he couldn't really hear her, or anyone else on the ship, as long as he was only human.

“Rue wasn't slowed down. She was sped up. She can't respond to you because subjectively, her reaction time was too retarded. Now that we're here, I think the ship is going to take her out of it.” She paused, adjusting something with an actuator. “I doubt if there will be much left.”

“What do you mean?” Molton asked. Something weird was going on with his subjectivity, too, by the look of it. He had taken a long time to ask the question, and his mouth was trembling oddly. The octopus began to wonder if telling Molton about Rue was a good idea. Behind him, the planet was changing, the winds calming, the air smelling more like spores and oxygen.

“I'm sorry, Molton. You weren't hired to entertain Rue with ancient folk ballads. You were there to torture her. She had been one of the anachronists that came to the Remote's home system, way back when.” There actually was a point, Mira realized, when Molton would realize he wasn't human anymore. “She and her buddies got a little carried away, for verisimilitude's sake. By the time the mechae got out of their blood and they inhaled some of the regulators that are always floating around to keep this kind of thing from happening, the planet was totally fucked. The Remote was the only part left of the entire gaia structure, so as a gesture of reparation they made it into a ship, and grafted in a bunch of upgrades.” The invisible machinery of the shield, now that most of the bio-power was running again, was starting to knit out clouds, gold-plated from the moon.

“Rue was the only sentient who wasn't sent to jail. She was only a few thousand years old at the time, and her family hired a good lawyer. So the ship abducted her, jacked her full of psychotropics and amphetamines, speeding up her metabolism and brain function, and gave her just one suggestion, just one line of code into her hypnogogic program: follow you around. We needed a human, because musically, your instincts would match hers, so hearing your songs, virtually forever, at a frequency decreased by a factor of six, and due to species-memory not being quite able to tune it out...”

Mira saw the moment happen in Molton's eyes.

# 3: Multiversal Fuels

The human musician knew enough about standard spacer tasks and nutrient maintenance not to be entirely useless, but the bionics of the ship could think of a hundred more valuable personnel it might have chosen.

Nearly all of the gray matter of the ship's zoology had been tapped into by the meta-processor, using a method that had been a short-lived trend 2000 or so years ago on the planet where the Remote had been constructed. Without much alteration of the animals' innate behavior, the super-organism could splice into their neural feeds, and use their brains to collectively run a parallel network powerful enough to host its own systems. Of course, most of the hard computing was done in the shuffling quanta of the pond-class engines themselves, and in the trillions of collapsed atomic possibilities harvested by the coils.

The humans inside of it, to the ship, were more or less irrelevant. Except for Rue, the one trapped in time-dilation. The cybernetic brain of the messenger-class had special reasons to watch that particular organism closely.

The ship had been honest, at least, about its intention to propagandize for the case of "reality-awareness", as the human relations department rather cleverly insisted on calling the campaign to educate certain backwards bipedals on the importance of giving up on Spike Travel, for the safety of the multiverse.

The Remote was among those who believed, and tried to convince others, that the galactic clouds were becoming slowly rent with too many holes from hyper-spikes, accumulating too many tiny sub-spatial knots, which could lead to some tipping-point event, an exponential cascade of catastrophe wherein positive feedback loops tripped the rapid and dynamic dismantling of the fabric of the spheres.

The majority of the scientifically-minded galactic sectors concurred that the gradual deterioration of the underlying drift layer, where hyper-spatial engines took advantage of the quasi-resolvable energies produced by superimposed metatomic positions (and so on, and so forth), was an observable and real phenomena, although the leading swarms still disagreed on how severe the effects of this sub-spatial abrasion would be, and how fast they would accelerate. They argued fiercely over whether or not certain remote space disasters were the result of ships encountering artifactual travel spikes, or simply normal fluctuations in the hyperreal.

Whateverâ€”the distributed engine-bubbling brain of the Remote wasn't of the class to weigh such issues, and it sensed that even if the doom-criers were right, there was no way that galactic civilization would voluntarily give up their spike-drives, dropping themselves back into the dark ages when relativistic speeds confined each sentient solar system to their own intolerably small, isolated well of information.

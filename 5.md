# 5: Radical Departures

They stepped or floated out of the locks and ramps onto the surface. It hadn't been power that had caused the homesteaders to jump planet or perish in not-so-dignified skeletal jumbles. The nuke buried kilometers below the surface was still churning out voltage, as were the geothermal backups. The research station appeared intact, as did the functional, if whimsical, habitations built into the silicate shelf.

There was no scientific reason for doing so, but Mira announced she wanted to take a scooter and explore the oxide-red foothills to the West, which would be well lit for dozens of hours yet by the titanic yellow moon, with a chunk missing from its profile (probably what used to be the two smaller satellites, one of which was greenly visible in the other part of the sky).

Molton said he would tag along.

Out on the blood-colored dunes, Mira laughed when Molton suggested they stay.

Small winged insects had been ferrying information from the biomind to the one-eyed octopus, ensconced in her scooter, which had four main legs branching into eight durable treads, easily compatible with the creature's existing neural structure. She had been telling the musician about what the Remote had learned concerning the fate of the colony.

The homestead had been abandoned for a little over a thousand years, so it would have already been a ghost colony when they set out from the kink in the spiral arm where the crew, at the other end of that unassimilable span of time, before a billion notes and Wirwid's sighs and Rue's impenetrable but (Molton always hoped) affectionate empty stares.

“Will you stop being human for a minute?” the ecologist translator asked. She meant the question literally—one of the eight tread stalks on the scooter extruded a manipulator and pulled from the scooter's casing a small hypodermic syringe, which Molton knew would contain the viral nanites to rewrite, temporarily, his DNA.

“Erm...being human is kind of my thing, you know. I would lose credibility.” He laughed weakly, pulling the tread of his boot through the dust. The behavior of the particles was familiar, since they had incrementally adjusted the gravity on the ship until it matched exactly what they were experiencing now. “It seems like a waste, after having gone through all of this as my chosen species.”

“Seriously, Molton, who are you performing for? Look around!” The amber wasteland coughed, whistling with its barren shelves and canyons, the terra and aero-forming swarms that the Remote had been speed-cloning since they landed having already begun to fuzz the landscape with cyborg bugs and minerals, and altering the shades of the sky through the puckering blister of the shield. “This is your audience, and trust me, it doesn't care.”

“It can change,” the musician said. “Everything can change.”

The eco-mind of the colony, as Mira had been telling him, had survived the colony's collapse, imbuing itself in the ice-burrowing thermaphiles her samples had turned up earlier. It hadn't been a singular disaster that had sealed the fate of the experimental homestead. It seemed, rather, a consequence of the cumulative effects of incompetence, desertion, and a general letting of everything go to shit. They had watched the sobering last of the settlers' logs, standing in the same common room that Molton remembered seeing in the original signal, where those smiling colonists had exhorted them to come and join their remote, uncorrupted utopia.

Without jumping through subspace, the flat-bodied, gelatinous leader had told them in the recording, it will be a long journey. But we will be here, waiting for you, at the end.

“No, it can't. Not in the way you think,” Mira said. Nictitating membranes blinked severally over her small, unreadable eye.

“Why do you hate me so much?” the musician asked her after a pause. He was feeling light-headed, and adjusted the dials on his neck-ring.

“Take it,” Mira said, holding out the syringe.

Molton grabbed the needle, fitting it into the port on his suit.

He waited. It would take a while. He wouldn't know when it happened. Inside the subjectivity of a species state, it was nearly impossible to detect the transfer from one neural medium to another.

He sat down. After a while, the actuators on the scooter whirred and Mira lowered herself at the personal distance they had established on the ship, and then, somewhat self-consciously, backed away a few meters.

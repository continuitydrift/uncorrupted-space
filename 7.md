#7: Conventional Endings

The debris of the planet, along with Rue and the biomind of the Remote, Multi-Hued Parabola, was gone before Molton knew how she felt about it (she, finally having had an epiphany regarding her relationship with Wirwid, had switched their own gender, taking a more proactive approach that, so far, had paid off handsomely). People were laughing around her, using the same galactic standard cant they had been using before he/she had left, even though for those on the cruise—zip, zip, zip!--they must have hopped to a million different points in the multiverse in the meantime, making money off of bounties all the way.

No one was sure if the cruise ship (hammer class) was within their legal rights to swoop in, dooming the entire planet by its arrival, all on the grounds of an open claim posted on some dubious frequency, but it didn't really matter. The planet, along with all the native and terraformed biomatter, would be incinerated as the Swift Justice Tours made its dramatic exit, using the planet's core as a propulsion system to break into the unreal spaces of not-quite-parallel dimensions. The titanic cruiser didn't have the fuel to pull itself out of orbit, and uncertainties between the location of the planet YRT-94B in different realities meant that it had to be destroyed prior to the spike.

The captain of the cruise ship, some kind of a lobster, assured him that it was quite dramatic and impressive, even after having seen it a few thousand times.

Now they were shooting away from the planet at sufficient speeds that, in ten seconds or so, would take them far enough away to make the swerve.

Molton's sense of time was skewed after the long, unsuspended voyage, tangled in algorithmic loops and long strings of music. Her thoughts seemed quick, but she was unable to respond intelligently to those around her. She couldn't stop staring up at the interlocking aqueous rings, as big as moons and holding oceans, along with representatives of hundreds of advanced systems, and billions of tons of conscious biomass.

Tourists, bringing death.

She (back when she was male) had talked to Rue for the first and last time just a few minutes before, down on the soon-to-be-obliterated surface.

“This is a recording,” the bio-programmer had said, in a voice Molton had never heard before, that made him/her want to tune it. “Things I memorized a long time ago: if you say that, then I will say this.”

“Don't,” the bard had begged. Rue had smiled, faintly. Molton had felt hope, and went on. “You know that I'm here. You can hear me. I'm here.”

“I remember what to say. This is a recording I made, mentally, before. Before. Tell Molton it's okay. It's already happened.”

“Don't say that. You're speaking to me. After all that space...”

“Patterns. There's nothing left; I remember what to say.”

The bard had persisted, but after a dozen or so iterations, he/she had left her near the abandoned homestead, watching her now through rents in the artificial clouds, the scene projected in a datasphere, through the Remote's imaging. She had barely moved.

The drift capacitors started to crack and hum as the dive into subspace was a few seconds closer, no one around her taking any note. Wirwid, far enough away on the curve of the ring that from Molton's perspective it looked like he should be falling over (they were no longer accelerating, and the centrifuge had started spinning with subtle force), caught her eye and winked. The smart-bearded Captain said that he hadn't known anything about Rue, or the grudge the Remote had held against her, and Molton believed him.

She hadn't seen Mira since they had come on board, and didn't want to.

Strangely, Molton felt content. Now that she was no longer human, and no longer male, the quixotic quest took on the heroic cast in retrospect that the bard had always hoped for. Not that anyone else would ever know. Still, she had changed—she had found something, brought it back. All of the meaningless, half-mechanical repetition, the duets with the damned ecological mind, the stubborn, stupid, species fidelity that had nearly driven her insane, it had all finally crystallized, become something akin, in her memories, to art, the music at last making sense as the coda back-filled into the torn, irradiated patches.

Molton felt a quiet, spiritual strength, her soul swelling from a near-infinite well, a charged battery of super-dense identity, a calm and comic posture taken in the wide gallery of galactic time. She knew, now, the songs she had been looking for—not a single melody but a tapestry of probable and possible notes and micro-tones, like a star map, with ribbons fluttering between the suns.

She and Wirwid had found another signal. Distant, but near enough to one of the Swift Justice’s stops that they could take a zodiac-class drifter out to the planet to check it out. It would be another long, long float, but they would let themselves hibernate, this time. They felt they were up to it. After that, they had agreed, if the colony was still there, they would settle down, and give up spike-drive jumps for good.

Generators fired and the lights of the terraqueous habitat rings dimmed, more as a signal than from any actual drain on power. Every time, they were triggering an infinitesimal (and yet infinitesimally greater with each jump) chance of inter-dimensional apocalypse. The stakes had been high back in the galaxy-wide wars of their romantic and savage fore-bearers, and yet the risks they were taking now, as a multiverse, would have alarmed even those reckless predecessors.

What would it feel like, Molton wondered, if every universe collapsed? Nothing. It was impossible to be afraid of because it was literally inconceivable, too large for vision, like the coming shadow of a giant moon. It was okay, Molton told herself, popping a stimulant bubble with her tongue as it floated by, breathing in the gas and waiting for the microswarms to tailor the drugs to her system. It probably wouldn’t happen, and there was no use worrying. It was how the multiverse worked. There was nothing they could do.

Back to being a hypocrite, Molton thought. She didn't even look human anymore, already starting to grow the gills that would let her swim around on what would be, for a while at least, her new home. They had even offered a chance to let her perform.

Nothing would ever change, she thought. These interlocking wheels would continue to plow through punctures in all the under-realities it didn't bear thinking about, slowly soiling and unraveling the last nest of conscious life, outside of which would be no escape, no shelter, nothing but the music. Someone next to her giggled. There was a brittle, breaking scrape, hurting ears or their equivalent, followed by a crack.

Everything changed.

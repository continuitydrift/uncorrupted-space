2: Melodic Disappointment
Molton, his mandolute in hand, had been about to launch into the spirit-lifting ballad he had spent the past few decades recording. At the word “dead,” along with all of the other sudden tumbling of ramifications through his mind, the mnemo-bard had also done a quick mental/musical calculation as to the possibilities of adapting the main theme to a more somber treatment, and the probability that this would be even slightly appropriate. A look from Mira's single, expressive eye caused the notes to evaporate faster than hull ice upon re-entry. Rue made one of her customary humming grunts, her mouth staying open far longer than it should have.
“Damn,” the Captain said. He looked up from his own blister of screen to the concave oval of the star-view, where the system they were aiming for, the sustainable homestead at the edge of the most remote supply chains reachable without reality bends, hung pointlessly in the distance.
It soaked in for each of them that they had been fooled, the automated signal emanating not from some idyllic, still-functioning far-flung planet of self-reliant homesteaders, but from a trap, the signal kept running most likely by some kind of scream-infested cannibals who would be descending on them any minute. Mira, the eco-translator—similar to what a pre-contact human might have called an octopus, with six or seven genders which could rotate depending on season, mood, and nutrient environment—felt a sinking in their stomach/trunk/limbs, well beyond what could be accounted for by the increased pull of gravity as they burned through thin wisps of atmosphere.
Mira was thinking how far they could get, once they were down on the surface, on half a tank of breathable air and a tread scooter. Then, morbidly, how far they could get on a full tank.


The quantum bio mind of the ship was built into a pseudo-strata of dispersed, genetically pliable plant matter and semi-complex organisms, wired (proverbially speaking) into the slight, not-quite random differentials latent in thermodynamic exchange-states.
It was basically in control of everything.
The vessel's nominal captain was little more than a symbolic figurehead fixed at the front of the ship for the sake of morale, a concession to primate instincts. The real decisions were made at the level of viral intelligence frothing in the ship's engines, chlorinating in its gardens, and sticking as hyper-sentient, luminescent slime to the eco-deck's painted sky, which at night rendered the upside-down bridge-world of the ring hemisphere seemingly invisible through photophoric and chromatophoric effects, so the humanoid and cephalapodian inhabitants could look up at replicated stars.
A mostly humanoid crew was an odd, antique arrangement, but one suited for Captain Wirwid's virtuous snail-crawl to the source of the transmission, in what the ship figured was a vain attempt to impress the hippie homestead with a reality-friendly voyage, free of any impolitic drift-spikes through alter spaces. The human musician and bio-programmer gave an added touch of authenticity to their selfless, slow, intentions. Wirwid was technically also transhominid, having spliced in some human traits out of sympathy, but he didn't really count.
Humans, despite their short lifespan, reportedly had psychological qualities suiting them for long, unbroken pilgrimages in space. The arboreally descended ape even naturally spent a third of their diurnal cycle in biological suspension, experiencing self-induced but autonomous hypnogogic visions. Amazingly, even with their original, pre-resurrection genetics, the species already had a built-in method for shunting and consolidating memories.
The ecosystem of the ship carrying Wirwid and the other temporal tourists across unheard of unfolded distances had nursed an interest in the ancient bipedal species ever since some creative anachronists had visited its ruined homeworld a few hundred years ago.
The Remote had had a chance for extensive study. What it lacked in sample size, it could make up for with an abundance of time and observational data. The bio-mind played endless improvised duets with Molton, reinforcing its belief that the algorithms informing the biped's music, while resembling that of bird-song, made far less sense, and were much less pleasing.
Molton, however, wasn’t playing his antediluvian folk songs for the eco-computer. Despite the contract, he wasn't playing them for Captain Wirwid, either. They were for Rue.

Rue was in suspension, they had told him. Slowed way, way down, to interface with the ship. Communication was impossible, but music was supposed to help, as was human contact. Stare them in the eyes, that sort of thing. Molton found the whole arrangement creepy, like serenading a zombie. Wirwid had suggested that Molton play his songs at about a sixth of their normal tempo, a ritardando that should make them sound normal to the sluggish senses of the bio-programmer.
It wasn't clear if Rue was even listening, but she followed Molton around, shuffling through the decks and walk-ribbons, sitting in the brain of the ship, under one of its trees, watching birds. Molton played and played, despite the lack of any visible response.
Once he stopped, and moving slowly, giving her time to turn away even at one-sixth the speed of his, took her hand, and kissed her lips.
Rue didn't react, and so the bard backed away and started playing again, slowly, exactly where he had left off.
